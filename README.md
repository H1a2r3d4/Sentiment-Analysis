# Sentiment-Analysis
Given a large dataset of tweets, the goal is to classify the sentiment of each tweet as either positive or negative. This classification can be useful for understanding public sentiment on a wide range of topics, such as brand perception, customer feedback, or societal trends.
The problem statement is to build and evaluate models that can classify text data i.e Tweets, product reviews into predefined sentiment categories (positive or negative). We will focus on comparing the performance of three machine learning classifiers:
1.	Linear Regression- A linear model that predicts the probability of a class.
2.	Naive Bayes Classifier: A simple, probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.
3.	Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy and handle overfitting.
The model will be trained on labeled tweet data and evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting sentiment on unseen tweets.

Objectives of the Project:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning the tweets by removing unnecessary elements such as URLs, mentions, special characters, etc.
   - Tokenizing the text into words and converting it into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
   - Vectorizing the text data using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings.

2. Model Building:
   - Build and compare multiple machine learning models for sentiment classification.
     - Logistic Regression: A linear model that predicts the probability of a class.
     - Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model that assumes independence between features.
     - Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees for classification.

3. Model Evaluation:
   - Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
   - Compare the performance of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning:
   - Use grid search or randomized search to optimize the hyperparameters for each model to achieve the best performance.

5. Deployment:
   - Once a satisfactory model is built, deploy it to classify tweets in real time for sentiment analysis tasks.

This project will provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of each classifier in dealing with text data for sentiment analysis.
